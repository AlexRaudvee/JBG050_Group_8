## Description

In an era where trust and confidence in law enforcement are paramount, this project delves into the realm of data science to better understand the determinants and predictors of public trust in the police, focusing on the context of the United Kingdom. Traditionally, police forces have prioritized crime detection and prevention, but there's a growing recognition that fostering trust among the public is equally critical. Through advanced data analysis and modeling techniques, this project aims to uncover insights that can inform strategies to enhance trust and confidence in law enforcement agencies.

#### Key Questions

- What factors influence public trust and confidence in the police?
- How can data science methodologies help identify and predict trends in trust levels?
- What actionable insights can be derived to improve trust-building efforts by law enforcement agencies?

#### Stakeholders:
1. The **M**etropolitan **P**olice **S**ervice (**“The Met”**)
2. The **M**ayor’s **O**ffice for **P**olicing **a**nd **C**rime (**MOPAC**)

## Contributions
Contributions to this repository are welcome from data scientists, researchers, policymakers, and anyone passionate about leveraging data-driven approaches to strengthen the relationship between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve. Whether it's data analysis, algorithm development, visualization, or policy recommendations, every contribution plays a vital role in advancing our understanding and fostering trust in the police.

Join us in the pursuit of building safer, more trusting communities through the power of data science.



## Data (dev)

The data can be loaded via [this link](https://data.police.uk/data/) chose the period for which you are going to download the data (for developers)

## Files (dev)

1. `Data_Exploration` Folder 

    - `exploration.py` - file in which we provide the first step to data exploration 

2. `config.py` - file with configurations that should be changed in your environment. 
3. `.gitignore` - files which are going to be ignored during your push actions
4. `LICENSE` - license of the project (dev) just in case

## How to Run

1. Download this repository or clone
2. Create environment 
3. Load the retirements by using ```pip install -r requirements```
4. Add the `data` folder in your working directory
5. Run the `exploration.py` file
